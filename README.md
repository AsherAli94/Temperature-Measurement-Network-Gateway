# Temperature-Measurement-Network-Gateway
•	System on Chip Zedboard Zync 7000 FPGA board.
•	CANopen sensor (s) attached with CAN bus for temperature sensing and transmitting of data using CAN protocol.
•	RTD temperature sensor MAX31865 used in 2 and 4 wire configuration for temperature sensing using SPI protocol for data transmission.
•	Multithreading for parallel execution.
•	TCP/IP protocol for forming client and server connection.
•	Java based GUI for the control of sensors and display of data.
•	Data from multiple sensors were sent at different sampling rate specified by the client side.
